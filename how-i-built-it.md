I followed [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKfJgfF0-XY) to get comfortable with openCV

> Get train data from [GitHub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opencv/opencv/master/data/haarcascades/haarcascade_frontalcatface_extended.xml) and save it in working directory  
> Load your test image file and convert it to GrayScale for _openCV_ to work  
> Try detecting co-ordinates of the face(s). __cv2.detectMultiScale()__ will yield  
> a list of [x y width height] co-ordinates  
> Draw a rectangle on a copy of original image to represent detected face
> Crop out examined faces for further analysis
